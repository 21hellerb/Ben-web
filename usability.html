	<h2> Method </h2>
	<p> The website I did my studies on was <a href="http://tsaweb.org/">tsaweb.org</a>. I have never been on this website before, but some of the information was very easy to find until the last task which took over a hundred clicks to come out with no correct answer.</p> 
	<h2> Results </h2>
	<p> The first task was to find the National Conference tab, which was pretty easy as it was a dropdown on the section that said conferences. The second task was also easy because it was to find the info on the 2014 conference, which had a link right near the top of the new page because it was less than five years ago. My final task was to find the name of who to conatact to enter the conference. This was not easy, as there was not a single name anywhere about contact, just a phone number. I believe this is a major flaw on the website, but then again the conference happened four years ago so maybe they took it down.</p>
	<h2> Discussion </h2>
	<p> I learned that sometimes on a new website, things are ver yeasy to find. For the fisrt task, I used logic to find out where the link was because it made the most sense to be there. I also learned, that some things are either impossible to find or just really hard, because no matter where you lookede on the website there was no name to contact for the 2014 conference, just a current phone number (for 2018).</p>
