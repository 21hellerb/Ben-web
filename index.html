		<h2> Unit 2 </h2>
		<p class="Summary"> Unit 2 in Mrs. Ashish's course was the HTML unit where we learned how to type code and we learned about 30 different basic tags. Some important tags we used were lists, tables, links, and inserting videos. Some vocabulary we learned are HTML, syntax, bugs, and debugging. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and is the language used to create documents on the web. Syntax means the rules of a language that must be followed when it is in use. Bugs are errors that do not follow the syntax, and debugging is fixing the bugs. This unit was very interesting and helpful because now I can actually code things without help. </p>

		<h2> Unit 3 </h2>
		<p class="Summary"> Unit 3 was the CSS unit. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and can be embedded in an html document or it can be seperate in a css document. This unit added on to the html unit, and we used both of the units together to create or own pages. We mostly learned how to change color wit hcss, how to make a webpage look good in css, the box model in css involving margins and spacing, the role of id and class to change certain elements, and page layout techniques. This unit allowed us to make unique webpages, which made coding a little more fun. </p>

		<h2> Unit 4 </h2>
		<p class="Summary"> Unit 4 was the graphics unit. This unit was based around adding images to the web page and changing certain factors about the graphics to make sure they are likeable and make sure they are different. Some of the key things we learned in this unit are copyright laws, cropping and resizing, layering, and selection tools in an image editing tool. Coopyright laws are how you must cite the image or data you are taking in your work. Cropping and resizing is how you mkae your image look nicer and not have too much information. Layering is the process of creating multiple layers for a single image, so that you can stack different things onto eachother to make just one image. Selection tools in photoshop were mostly to help us learn how to manage pictures and work with them in the way we want to. </p>

		<h2> Unit 5 </h2>
		<p class="Summary"> Unit 5 was a lesson on scripting and added function to what we were already doing in HTML and CSS. We started by finding the difference between Client-side and Server-side scripting and then began to use JavaScript very basically to make a clock and create an alert button. The clock we learned how to make measures the real time, and the alerrt we created can pop up in any browser with any text. </p>
