<h2 id="evaluation"> Evaluation of Web Graphics </h2>
</a>

<p> It is important to let the other content of the page lead the graphics because you do not want a web page based around just graphics, because people that are color-blind and people that have any type of sight disability will have trouble with your website. 
Also, you do not want your website to be just a bunch of images, because it will be too much for the eye to handle at once. 
This may not be the case with something like Google Images, because it is a browser for finding images.</p>

<p> Graphics should fit the purpose of the page so they aren't useless code, and the web page is not a mess. Graphics should not be large files because people want their websites to load quicker, not slower. 
Graphics should guide viewers to important information because graphics stand out from the rest of the page, just like a highlighter. Avoid "obnoxious" images so the viewer does not lose patience with the site, and get annoyed. 
Avoid graphics to convey textual info in case some people are color-blind and the images aren't the same for them. Provide textual alternatives for all grahpic content for this reason. When using text inside of graphics,
make sure it is legible so people don't miss out on anything they need to see.
Another guideline could be to not make the images on the page so large, so they take up all the intention. It is important that all of the information and text still gets attention and not just large pictures.</p>

<h3> Amazon.com </h3>

<h3> https://www.amazon.com/ </h3>

<p> I feel the graphics are very well placed and very important to the page. Every single item Amazon sells has an image of that item so you can see what you get, not just read it. </p>

<p> Amazon.com especially does well with providing textual equivalents to the images, and the graphics fit well with the style of the page. 
One thing that can be improved on is making sure the images guide the viewer's focus to the important page information. </p>

<h2> Copyright Law </h2>

<p> I think most images on the web are copyrighted because they are works created by people or by groups of people. 
The images that aren't copyrighted are ones that the creators feel like the world should use for free without asking for permission. </p>

<p> If you are a webpage designer on the web, Copyright Laws will limit your uses of images and text from other sources without permission, 
making sure a lot of the work on the page will be made by you, the creator of your page. </p>
